# Takeaways
Please remember thes things


## Chapter 1 - Professionalism

### Do no harm to function
Remember that you're ultimately responsible to what gets shipped out.
  * be as close to 100% to sure the job is "done"
  * via it be local testing, automated tests, uat-testing, etc.

Worry that the job is done and done correctly - remove yourself, your ego from the equation. If an error/bug occurs on your watch, learn how it went past notice, catalog it as something to lookout for next time.

### Do no harm to structure
Software  is (should be) easy to change. _You must be able to make changes without exorbitant costs._
  * Avoid making inflexible code structures
  * Avoid quickfixes that compromise structure
  * Codebase should be able to handle frequent code changes/ refactorings without worry of compromising functionality
  * _Always check in a module cleaner than when you checked it out_ (random acts of kindness to the code)

### Identify with your Employer/Customer
Understand the problems of the people you work for/under. Adopting the problems as your own gives you skin in the game to _want_ fix a problem.
  * design/develop features with the customer in mind
  * avoid us vs them attitude with stakeholders
